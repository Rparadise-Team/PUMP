Greetings to everyone.

**Rparadise** presents **"PUMP"**, an improved system based on the Trimui Smart base system for firmware **1.0** and **1.0.1**. This project started as a personal endeavor, but in the end, we decided to share it with our community. It grew so much that we ultimately decided to release it here. We hope you all enjoy it.

The main features are:

- Unified visual style in icons and backgrounds for each system.
- Changed the image path for each game to make it compatible with those used in Koriki, now located inside the roms folder of each system, in the **"Imgs"** folder.
- Added systems, making a total of **53**, either by compiling cores or updating those that did not work with this new firmware version. These include: **Amiga, Arduboy, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, Amstrad CPC, Capcom Play System 1, Capcom Play System 2, Capcom Play System 3, Commodore 64, DOOM, MS-DOS, Nintendo DS, Final Burn Neo, NES, Famicom Disk System, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Game & Watch, Lynx, MAME, Mega Drive, Master System, MSU1, Mega Drive MSU, MSX, Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo, Neo Geo Pocket, Magnavox Odyssey 2, OpenBOR, PC Engine, PC Engine CD, Pico 8, Pok√©mon Mini, Ports, PlayStation, Quake, ScummVM, Sega 32X, Sega CD, Super Nintendo, SG-1000, Super Game Boy, Supervision, Tic-80, Virtual Boy, Wolfenstein 3D, WonderSwan, X68000, ZX Spectrum**.
- All systems have been optimized to use the lowest possible CPU frequency to improve power consumption.
- Custom bezels created and added to all handheld systems that use them in their correct aspect ratio.
- Preconfigured RetroArch and hotkeys for all systems.
- Ports ready to run with the current firmware version, including **Streets of Rage Remake**, located inside the **"Ports"** folder. The list of ports includes: **CannonBall, Cave Story, Dinothawr, Flashback, Mr. Boom, Rick Dangerous, Streets of Rage Remake, and VVVVVV**.
- Added the **"Comander"** application under **"Apps"**, an essential tool thanks to **Jutley**.

A big thank you to Jutley for his amazing work on **"Tomato"** which served as inspiration to start working on PUMP, to **Steward Fuu** for his incredible work on **"Drastic"** and the Streets of Rage Remake port, and especially to my colleagues and friends **Ninoh-Fox** and **Alber** for their help and support in this project. Without Ninoh assisting me with the cores and configurations and without Alber's artistic touch on the icons, backgrounds, and bezels, the final result of PUMP would not have been nearly as successful.
